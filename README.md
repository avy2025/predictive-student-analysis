## **Code Explanation**

### **1. Backend (`app.py`)**
- **Purpose**: Handles routing and API logic.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/`: Serves the main webpage.
  - `/predict`: Accepts user input and returns career suggestions or tips.

#### Example Code Snippet:
```python
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json
    interest = data.get("interest", "").capitalize()

    if interest in career_data:
        career_options = career_data[interest]
        return jsonify({"career": career_options})
    else:
        career_options = random.choice(career_data["Non-Conventional"])
        tips = success_tips.get(career_options, "Stay motivated and keep learning!")
        return jsonify({"career": [career_options], "tips": tips})
```

### **2. Frontend (`templates/index.html`)**
- **Purpose**: Provides the user interface for input and displays results.
- **Key Elements**:
  - Input form for field of interest.
  - JavaScript for making API calls and updating the DOM dynamically.

#### Example Code Snippet:
```html
<form id="interestForm">
    <label for="interest">Enter Your Field of Interest:</label>
    <input type="text" id="interest" name="interest" placeholder="e.g. Technology, Arts, Business">
    <button type="submit">Predict</button>
</form>
```

### **3. Styling (`static/style.css`)**
- **Purpose**: Enhances visual aesthetics of the webpage.
- **Key Features**:
  - Centered layout for better usability.
  - Hover effects on buttons.

#### Example Code Snippet:
```css
.container {
    background: white;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    max-width: 400px;
    margin: auto;
}

button:hover {
    background-color: #218838;
}
```
